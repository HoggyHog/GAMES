# PING-PONG

Basic ping pong game using HTML, CSS, JS. 

## INSTRUCTIONS

The goal is to touch the ball the specified number of times using the left paddle to score a point, and on scoring 5 points first, you win the game. But 
mind you, the speed increases as time passes. And to add to the mix, Ive also applied some color-changing effect to the background, ball and paddel, as
time passes to make the game more interactive
